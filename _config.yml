A web scraper collates the top 10 NY times articles shared on social media and compares the article's emotional content.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Data Science</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of statistical (logarithmic regression / decision trees / random forests) and machine learning methods to quantify various types of categorical and numerical data. I am an experienced user of the R statistical programming language and SQL database tools to manage, modify and keep track of large datasets.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: I am a current participant in the Amazon sponsored FastAI deep learning course put on by Brisbane AI. I am currently working on a semantic segmentation deep learning model with a team of 3 colleagues as part of this challenge. Through this challenge, extensive use of Tensorflow, Keras and Numpy was needed.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Cloud Infrastructure</strong>: I am used to working in teams using Jira, git and the Agile sprint methodology. I have worked with and managed AWS EC2 instances, utilised s3 for file hosting and managed access permissions on IAM. I have experience working with Microsofts machine learning server and its interactions with R, and integration into an exisiting web application. </br><br/>
