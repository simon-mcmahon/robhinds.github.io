			I am a mathematician by training with a love and aptitude for practical problem solving. I possess the background needed to understand complex algorithms and the coding experience with languages and frameworks (i.e. Python (Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Gurobi), R, MATLAB, Git) to see them through development. </br></br>
			In the course of my extra-curricular and internship opportunities I have implemented machine learning and statistical algorithms in the Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft cloud ecosystems (Azure). For instance, I have helped a financial services company put their own take on a credit scoring system in R and am currently working in a team pursuing a deep learning project to classify features on radio towers using Python and Tensorflow.</br></br>
			I believe a crucial difference between myself and other technically talented people in mathematics and data science is my communication and sales experience. Throughout my role building a tutoring company part time as I studied in university, I literally explained challenging mathematical concepts 15-20 hours a week for over 3 years. I became well-versed in listening to client feedback, maintaining customer relationships and communicating clearly.</br></br>
